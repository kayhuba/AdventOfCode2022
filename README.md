# AdventOfCode2022

From https://adventofcode.com/2022 :

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This repo contains my personal implementation of the various puzzles. It's a pure fun project.

When crawling through the code, please remember that I always tried (and almost always managed) to solve the puzzles at the day where they've been published. I have family, I'm an employee. There's only little spare time to solve the puzzles. 
I'm proud that I managed to find the solutions myself (by writing the code you find in this repo and run it). However, I did not at all follow my own usual quality standards in terms of documentation, code structuring, testing, variable naming etc. It's just done quick and dirty.
